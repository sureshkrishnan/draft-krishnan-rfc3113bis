1.  Introduction

   The IETF, as an organization, has the need to engage in direct
   communication or joint work with various other formal organizations.
   For example, the IETF is one of several Standards Development
   Organizations, or SDOs, and SDOs including the IETF find it
   increasingly necessary to communicate and coordinate their activities
   involving Internet-related technologies.  This is useful in order to
   avoid overlap in work efforts, and to manage interactions between
   their groups.  In cases where the mutual effort to communicate and
   coordinate activities is formalized, these relationships are
   generically referred to as "liaison relationships".

   In such cases, a person is designated by the IAB to manage a given
   liaison relationship; that person is generally called the "IETF
   liaison manager" to the other organization.  Often, the other
   organization will similarly designate their own liaison manager to
   the IETF.

   This document is chiefly concerned with:

   *  the establishment and maintenance of liaison relationships, and

   *  the appointment and responsibilities of IETF liaison managers.

   The management of other organizations' liaison managers to the IETF,
   whether or not in the context of a liaison relationship, is outside
   the scope of this document.

   The IETF has chartered the Internet Architecture Board to manage the
   formal liaison relationships.  Consistent with its charter [BCP39],
   the IAB acts as representative of the interests of the IETF in
   technical liaison relationships with other organizations concerned
   with standards, and other technical and organizational issues
   relevant to the worldwide Internet.  Liaison relationships are kept
   informal whenever possible, and must possess demonstrable value to
   the IETF's technical mandate.  Individual participants from the IETF
   community are appointed as liaison managers to other organizations by
   the IAB.

   In general, a liaison relationship is most valuable when there are
   areas of technical development of mutual interest.  For the most
   part, SDOs would rather leverage existing work done by other
   organizations than recreate it themselves (and would like the same
   done with respect to their own work).  Establishing a liaison
   relationship can provide the framework for ongoing communications to

   *  prevent inadvertent duplication of effort, without obstructing
      either organization from pursuing its own mandate;

   *  provide authoritative information of one organization's
      dependencies on the other's work.

   It is important to note that participation in the IETF work is open
   to everyone, and all the working documents and RFCs are freely
   available to everyone without the need for a formal liaison
   relationship.  Hence, in almost all cases the need for a formal
   relationship is mostly driven by other organizations rather than by
   the IETF.

1.1.  Changes compared to RFC4052

   This version of the document contains the following updates:

   1.  Notes in the Introduction and Section 2.1 on "Liaison
       Relationships" that the IETF process itself does not require a
       formal liaison relationship, e.g. for document access or meeting
       participation, and therefore the need for a formal liaison
       relationship is often driven by processes of the peer
       organization.

   2.  Statement that the "IAB acts as representative of the interests
       of [..] the Internet Society" has been removed.

   3.  Role of the Liaison Representative (Section 2.3) has been removed
       since this role is not used in pratice.

   4.  Clarifcation in section on "Liaison Communication" (now 2.3; was
       2.4) that informal channels are preferred, with and without a
       formal liaison relationship, and further that liaison statements
       have no "special standing" in the IETF process.

   5.  Section 4 on "Approval and Transmission of Liaison Statements"
       has been moved to 4053bis.

2.  Aspects of Liaisons and Liaison Management

2.1.  Formal Liaison Relationships

   A formal liaison relationship is established when it is mutually
   agreeable and required for some specific purposes, as viewed by the
   other organization, the IAB, and the IETF participants conducting the
   work.  Some potential purposes include:

   *  The other organization requires a formal liaison relationship in
      order to provide access to their working documents or standards.

   *  A formal liaison relationship is required to provide input to
      ongoing work at other organizations.

   *  Required to participate in meetings of other organizations

   There is no set process or form for this; the IETF participants and
   the peer organization approach the IAB, and after discussion come to
   an agreement to form the relationship.  In some cases, the intended
   scope and guidelines for the collaboration are documented
   specifically (e.g., see [RFC3113], [RFC3131], and [RFC3356]).

   In setting up the relationship, the IAB expects that there will be a
   mutual exchange of views and discussion of the best approach for
   undertaking new standardization work items.  Any work items resulting
   for the IETF will be undertaken using the usual IETF procedures,
   defined in [BCP9].  The peer organization often has different
   organizational structure and procedures than the IETF, which will
   require some flexibility on the part of both organizations to
   accommodate.  There is an expectation that both organizations will
   use the relationship carefully, allowing sufficient time for the
   requests they make on the other organization to be processed.

2.2.  Liaison Manager

   As described above, most work on mutually interesting topics will be
   carried out in the usual way within the IETF and the peer
   organization.  Therefore, most communications will be informal in
   nature (for example, Working Group (WG) or mailing list discussions).

   An important function of the liaison manager is to ensure that
   communication is maintained, productive, and timely.  He or she may
   use any applicable businesslike approach, from private to public
   communications, and bring in other parties as needed.  If a
   communication from a peer organization is addressed to an
   inappropriate party, such as being sent to the WG but not copying the
   Area Director (AD) or being sent to the wrong WG, the liaison manager
   will help redirect or otherwise augment the communication.

   IETF liaison managers should also communicate and coordinate with
   other liaison managers where concerned technical activities overlap.

   Since the IAB is ultimately responsible for liaison relationships,
   anyone who has a problem with a relationship (whether an IETF
   participant or a person from the peer organization) should first
   consult the IAB's designated liaison manager, and if that does not
   result in a satisfactory outcome, the IAB itself.

2.3.  Liaison Communications

   Communications between organizations use a variety of formal and
   informal channels irrespective of established liaison relationships.
   The stated preference of the IETF, which is largely an informal
   organization, is to use informal channels (e.g., discussion on expert
   level in specific Working group Meeting or mailing list), as these
   have integrated better into IETF process and historically worked well
   to expedite matters.  In some cases, however, a more formal
   communication is appropriate, either as an adjunct to the informal
   channel or in its own place with or without liaison relationship.  In
   the case of formal communications, the established procedures of many
   organizations use a form known as a "liaison statement".  Procedures
   for sending, managing, and responding to liaison statements are
   discussed in [RFC4053].

   Note that communications between organizations have no difference to
   any other IETF contributions and should follow the same IETF process
   and polices and should be open to everyone for inputs and
   contributions, e.g., input discussion in specific working group in
   the IETF.

3.  Summary of IETF Liaison Manager Responsibilities

   The main responsibility of the liaison manager is to ensure good and
   formally correct communication between the organizations.  This often
   includes:

   *  Ensure received LSs are recorded and delivered to the relevant
      groups.

   *  Ensure replies are sent in time or it is appropriately
      communicated why a reply is delayed or not sent.

   *  Ensure liaison statements from the IETF adhere to the formal
      requirements of the peer organization (e.g. formatting) and are
      delivered to the appropriate groups.

   *  Provide additional communication on e.g. process or known
      consensus positions in the IETF.  This may also require
      participation in relevant meetings of the peer organization and
      potentially report back to the appropriate IETF organization any
      material information that is intended to be shared by the peer
      organization.

   Formal messages from the IETF to the peer organization are usually
   carried in liaison statements.  In certain situations, the liaison
   manager may carry addional messages, when specifically instructed.
   However, if these communications aim to "represent the IETF", they
   must have consensus, e.g. by being based on an RFC or some other
   formal statement by a group within the IETF.

   Optionally liaison manager may provide updates to the IAB on
   technical matters.  Especially if a concern e.g. regarding technical
   overlap or incorrectness is detected this should be communicated to
   the IAB.  However, given most organization are quite large, it is not
   expected that the liaison manager can have the full overview about
   everything that is going on.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security of the Internet is not threatened by these procedures.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
